The aim of this project is to provide a few electronic services to Municipality employees and clients (citizens), where employees can track their tasks and clients can track the status of their requests online. This project is intended as my final project for Master degree. On this project I'm working in coordination with a Municipality POC and my mentor of master degree program.

Since now, on this project next mentioned modules were implemented: Snowfire Beautymail (https://madewithlaravel.com/beautymail) and AdminLTE (https://adminlte.io/).

User management part is completed and full functional while, services required from Municipality are in progres.
